	abstract = {This paper deals with the calculation of the effective delayed neutron fraction (βeff) in circulating-fuel nuclear reactors. The Molten Salt Fast Reactor is adopted as test case for the comparison of the analytical, deterministic and Monte Carlo methods presented. The Monte Carlo code {SERPENT}-2 has been extended to allow for delayed neutron precursors drift, according to the fuel velocity field. The forward and adjoint eigenvalue multi-group diffusion problems are implemented and solved adopting the multi-physics tool-kit {OpenFOAM}, by taking into account the convective and turbulent diffusive terms in the precursors balance. These two approaches show good agreement in the whole range of the {MSFR} operating conditions. An analytical formula for the circulating-to-static conditions βeff correction factor is also derived under simple hypotheses, which explicitly takes into account the spatial dependence of the neutron importance. Its accuracy is assessed against Monte Carlo and deterministic results. The effects of in-core recirculation vortex and turbulent diffusion are finally analysed and discussed.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors ({MSRs}) were conceived at the early stages of nuclear energy in view of the favourable features fostered by a liquid fuel. They were developed as graphite-moderated thorium-fuelled breeder reactors till the seventies, when studies on this reactor concept were mostly abandoned in favour of the liquid–metal fast breeder concepts. A decade ago, the {MSRs} were included among the six {GEN}-{IV} systems and a core optimization process allowing for the {GEN}-{IV} main objectives led toward a fast-spectrum {MSR} concept ({MSFR} – Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Albeit advantageous in terms of U-233 breeding and/or radio-active waste burning, the new concept lacks the notable know-how available for the thermal-spectrum {MSR} technology. The present paper preliminarily investigates the {MSR} dynamics, based on the conceptual {MSFR} design currently available. A primary objective is to benchmark two different models of the {MSFR} primary circuit, both of them including a detailed and fully-coupled (node-wise) representation of turbulent fuel-salt flow, neutron diffusion, and delayed-neutron precursor diffusion and convection. A good agreement is generally observed between the adopted models, though some discrepancies exist in the temperature-field, with ensuing mild impacts on the reactor dynamics. The performed analyses are also used for a preliminary characterization of the {MSFR} steady-state and accidental transient response. Some points of enhancement needed in the {MSFR} conceptual design are identified, mainly related to in-core velocity and temperature fields. The reactor response following major accidental transient initiators suggests a generally benign behaviour of this reactor concept.},

	abstract = {Serpent is a recently developed 3D continuous-energy Monte Carlo ({MC}) reactor physics burnup calculation code. Serpent is specifically designed for lattice physics applications including generation of homogenized few-group constants for full-core core simulators. Currently in Serpent, the few-group constants are obtained from the infinite-lattice calculations with zero neutron current at the outer boundary. In this study, in order to account for the non-physical infinite-lattice approximation, B1 methodology, routinely used by deterministic lattice transport codes, was considered for generation of leakage-corrected few-group cross sections in the Serpent code. A preliminary assessment of the applicability of the B1 methodology for generation of few-group constants in the Serpent code was carried out according to the following steps. Initially, the two-group constants generated by Serpent were compared with those calculated by Helios deterministic lattice transport code. Then, a 3D analysis of a Pressurized Water Reactor ({PWR}) core was performed by the nodal diffusion code {DYN}3D employing two-group cross section sets generated by Serpent and Helios. At this stage thermal–hydraulic (T-H) feedback was neglected. The {DYN}3D results were compared with those obtained from the 3D full core Serpent {MC} calculations. Finally, the full core {DYN}3D calculations were repeated taking into account T-H feedback and assuming Hot Full Power ({HFP}) conditions. The B1 two-group cross sections and diffusion coefficients generated by the Serpent and Helios codes agree within less than 2.5\%. The results of the {DYN}3D calculations with the Serpent B1 cross section sets agree very well with those of the Serpent full core {MC} calculations. The relative difference in keff is below 300pcm. The maximum and root mean square ({RMS}) difference in the radial power distribution is 2.7\% and 1.1\% respectively. The results of the {DYN}3D full core calculations with T-H feedback obtained with Helios and Serpent generated cross section libraries show an excellent agreement as well. The estimated critical boron concentration agrees within 5ppm. The maximum and {RMS} difference in the core radial power peaking factors is 0.8\% and 0.4\% respectively. In this study, a Matlab script was used for calculation of the leakage-corrected few-group cross sections, however, the B1 methodology has recently been implemented directly in the Serpent code.},

Topics include molecules as elastic spheres and as centers of force, external forces and visible motions of the gas and the repelling force between molecules. Part {II} covers van der Waals' theory, the principles of general mechanics needed for a gas theory, gases with compound molecules, derivation of van der Waals' equation by means of the virial concept, theory of dissociation and supplements to the laws of thermal equilibrium in gases with compound molecules.Combining rigorous mathematical analysis with pragmatic treatment of physical and chemical applications, Lectures on Gas Theory was the standard work on kinetic theory in the first quarter of the 20th century.

This “nuclear renaissance” would have to be implemented with breeder reactors because today's commercial nuclear fuel cycle is unsustainable and based upon a fuel (235U) that is intrinsically expensive and politically problematic. The purpose of this paper is to point out why a simple/cheap “minimal reprocessing” implementation of the European Union's ({EU}'s) molten salt fast reactor ({MSFR}) concept represents the most promising way to implement that technical fix: 



* It would be relatively simple/cheap to both build and operate,


* Its fuel cycle is genuinely sustainable (no fuel shortages “forever”),


* Radwaste management would also be relatively simple and cheap,


* Operation would neither generate nor require huge amounts of transuranic ({TRU}) elements,


* The consequences of accidents (fuel spills, etc.) would be relatively benign,


* When steady state is achieved, the world would no longer need its uranium enrichment facilities.

Its primary drawback is that it would require virtually everyone currently involved with managing, researching, implementing, regulating, or “helping” the {USA}'s nuclear power industry to embrace a massive paradigm shift.},
